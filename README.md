This mod adds a tag to each user based on their priviledges

`player` -> given to all users who do not have the `server` or `ownerTag` priviledges  
`admin` -> given to all users who have the `server` but not the `ownerTag` priviledge  
`owner` -> given to all users who have the `server` and `ownerTag` priviledges

The visual mod also works well with IRC and other mods such as the robot spawner mods some servers use.
Players requested that I release what I had written for the visual so here you go.

Feedback is welcome.
